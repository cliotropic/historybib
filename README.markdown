History Bibliography  
[Lincoln Mullen][]  
[lincoln@lincolnmullen.com][]  

This is a [BibTeX][] database that I use for citing works in [Pandoc][]
and [LaTeX][]. It reflects only works that I have cited in certain
projects. The works are mostly about American religious history or early
America. The BibTeX entries are intended to work with Chicago Manual of
Style citations.

Because I now keep most of my reseach in a [Gitit][], I import all the
BibTeX references from that wiki, then `cat` them together with the
older references to create the `master.bib` database. You can probably
safely ignore any of the other BibTeX files in this repository.

You are welcome to use this database however you see fit. You can clone
the database, of course, but I suggest that you [fork the GitHub
repository][] first. Contributions are welcome. You can submit them by
sending a pull request.

The files in the `bibtool-rsc` directory are resource files that sort
and normalize the BibTeX database. I have borrowed these wholesale from
Kieran Healy's [socbibs repository][]. They are intended to be used with
the utility [BibTool][].

I used to generate most of the initial citation data by exports from
[Zotero][]. I've modified Zotero's `bibtex.js` file to give citation
keys in the form `smith1984firstword`, which is the same form used by
Google Books and Google Scholar. Most of the metadata is hand curated.

You might like my [Bibkeys][] Ruby Gem to generate a list of citation
keys.
